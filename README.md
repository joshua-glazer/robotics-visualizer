# robotics-visualizer

The goal of this project is to build an interactive web app which allows a user to apply rotations and translations onto a reference frame and to view the effects.

Desired features:
- input information about rotations along axes (fixed axis or euler axis rotations) and view the effects
- input rotation matrices or translation matrices and vew the effects

Potential future features:
- forward kinematics with DH parameters
- inverse kinematics
