# robotics-visualizer

The goal of this project is to build an interactive web app which allows a user to apply rotations and translations onto a reference frame and to view the effects.

Current features:
- (to debug) input fixed angles and visualize the rotations
- input euler angles and visualize the rotations
- input axis and angle and visualize the rotation

Desired features:
- input rotation matrices or translation matrices and vew the effects
- track chains of reference frames rather than simply a tool frame compared to the base frame

Potential future features:
- forward kinematics with DH parameters
- inverse kinematics
