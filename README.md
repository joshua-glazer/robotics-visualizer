# robotics-visualizer

The goal of this project is to build an interactive web app which allows a user to apply rotations and translations onto a reference frame and to view the effects.

Current features:
- input fixed angles, euler angles or an axis vector and angle, and visualize the rotations

Desired features:
- start from an orientation the user defines rather than the world frame's orientation
- input rotation matrices or translation matrices and vew the effects
- track chains of reference frames rather than simply a tool frame compared to the base frame

Potential future features:
- forward kinematics with DH parameters
- inverse kinematics
